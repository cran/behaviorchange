\item{input}{Either a link to a Google Sheet, or a path to an Excel file.}

\item{title}{The title of the COMPLECS graph.}

\item{layout}{The layout to use; has to be one of the \code{DiagrammeR} layout
types (\code{dot}, \code{neato}, \code{circo} and \code{twopi}).}

\item{outputFile}{A character vector where each element is one path (including
filename) to write the graph to.}

\item{outputWidth, outputHeight}{If not \code{NULL}, a way to override the width and
height when calling \code{complecs} to generate a COMPLECS overview.}

\item{returnSvgOnly}{Whether to only return the SVG in a character vector.}

\item{maxLabelLength}{The number of characters where to wrap the labels.}

\item{x}{The object to print (i.e. a result of a call to \code{complecs}).}

\item{width, height}{If not \code{NULL}, a way to override the width and
height when calling \code{print} to print a COMPLECS overview.}

\item{...}{Any additional arguments for the \code{\link[=print]{print()}} method are passed
to \code{\link[DiagrammeR:render_graph]{DiagrammeR::render_graph()}}.}

\code{output$graph} and \code{output$graphSvg}.

\description{
COMPLECS was developed to help make sense of complex systems. It reads data from a
number of worksheets in a spreadsheet and generates a diagram according to those
specifications. Originally, COMPLECS was developed to visualise a problem during
the needs assessment phase of intervention development.
}
\details{
COMPLECS is a recursive acronym for COMPLECS Organises Multiple Players & Linked
Environments using Connected Specifications.
