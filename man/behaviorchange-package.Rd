\title{behaviorchange: Tools for Behavior Change Researchers and Professionals}
\description{
Contains specialised analyses and visualisation tools for behavior change science. These facilitate conducting determinant studies (for example, using confidence interval-based estimation of relevance, CIBER, or CIBERlite plots, see Crutzen, Noijen & Peters (2017) \doi{10/ghtfz9}), systematically developing, reporting, and analysing interventions (for example, using Acyclic Behavior Change Diagrams), and reporting about intervention effectiveness (for example, using the Numbers Needed for Change, see Gruijters & Peters (2017) \doi{10/jzkt}), and computing the required sample size (using the Meaningful Change Definition, see Gruijters & Peters (2020) \doi{10/ghpnx8}). This package is especially useful for researchers in the field of behavior change or health psychology and to behavior change professionals such as intervention developers and prevention workers.
